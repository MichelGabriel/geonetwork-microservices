## Persistence

The persistence module easily setup database connection and database model load into a service. 

The `common-persistence` module:
* adds required dependencies to connect to the database
* configure the database connection and model.

It is for now based on GeoNetwork 4 domain model. This may change in the future as it adds many dependencies not needed here (eg. gn-commons and all dependencies ...).
